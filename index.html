                <p>
                    This project aims to discover and index the catalogs of industrial manufacturers and companies on the web. <br><br>
                    To achieve this, a focused crawler must be designed to efficiently crawl the web and index relevant documents. <br><br>
                    There are several ways to detect the relevance of a document. In this project, weighted topic word table is used.
                    In short, relevant pages are semi-manually inserted, and keywords are extracted using statistical formulas. <br><br>
                    The flowchart of the project is shown below.
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <img src="assets/flowchart.jpeg"">
                </div>
                <p>After manually seeding URLs, the crawler starts visiting documents and inserting the links into the frontier.</p>
                <p>The cosine similarity formula is used to compare the similarity between a document and the weighted topic word table.</p>
                <p>Inserted links in the frontier are further checked, ranked, sorted, and eliminated accordingly.</p>
                <p>If a document is evaluated as irrelevant, the crawler doesn't remove the page, nor does it ignore the links within the document. Instead, it is inserted into the irrelevant table to apply the <b>irrelevant-to-relevant</b> algorithm.</p>
                <div style="width: 800px; text-align: center;">
                    <img src="assets/irr_to_rel.jpeg" style="width: 750px;">
                </div>

                <p>This chart demonstrates the results of irrelevant-to-relevant algorithm.</p>
                <p>To discover relevant documents via irrelevant ones, the crawler visits up to 3 consecutive irrelevant documents and ranks their links.</p>
                <p>According to this logic, Page 1 will not be visited because it can only be reached after 3 consecutive irrelevant documents.</p>
                <p>However, Page 2 will be reached after 2 consecutive irrelevant documents.</p>
                <p>The order of visit for Page 3 and Page 4 depends on their link scores.</p>
                <p>Link scores depend on the quality and quantity of the pages that contain that link, similar to Google Search's PageRank algorithm, as well as similarity between URL and anchor and weighted topic word table.</p>
