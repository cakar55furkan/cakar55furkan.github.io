                <p>
                    This project aims to discover and index the catalogs of industrial manufacturers and companies on the web. <br><br>
                    To achieve this, a focused crawler must be designed to efficiently crawl the web and index relevant documents. <br><br>
                    There are several ways to detect the relevance of a document. In this project, <b>topic specific weight table</b> is used.
                    In short, several relavant pages are visited by using general purpose search engine, and keywords are extracted using statistical formulas. <br><br>
                    The flowchart of the project is shown below.
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <img src="assets/flowchart.jpeg"">
                </div>
                <p>After manually seeding URLs, the crawler starts visiting documents and inserting the links into the frontier.</p>
                <div style="width: 800px; text-align: center;">
                    <img src="assets/relevancy.jpeg" style="width: 500px; margin: 40px;">
                </div>
                <p>This formula computes the cosine similarity between topic word table and the document. Location and quantity of the terms that document contains affects the relevancy score.</p>
                <p>Inserted links in the frontier are checked, ranked, sorted, and eliminated accordingly, by calculating the link score.</p>
                <p>If a document is evaluated as irrelevant, the crawler doesn't remove the page, nor does it ignore the links within the document. Instead, it is inserted into the irrelevant table to apply the <b>irrelevant-to-relevant</b> algorithm.</p>
                <div style="width: 800px; text-align: center;">
                    <img src="assets/irr_to_rel.jpeg" style="width: 750px; margin: 40px;">
                </div>

                <p>This chart demonstrates the results of irrelevant-to-relevant algorithm.</p>
                <p>To discover relevant documents via irrelevant ones, the crawler visits up to 3 consecutive irrelevant documents and ranks their links.</p>
                <p>According to this logic, Page 1 will not be visited because it can only be reached after 3 consecutive irrelevant documents.</p>
                <p>However, Page 2 will be reached after 2 consecutive irrelevant documents.</p>
                <p>The order of visit for Page 3 and Page 4 depends on their link scores.</p>
                <p><b>Link scores</b> depend on the quality and quantity of the pages that contain that link, similar to Google Search's PageRank algorithm, as well as similarity between URL, anchor and weighted topic word table.</p>
                <div style="width: 800px; text-align: center;">
                    <img src="assets/link_score.jpeg" style="width: 500px; margin: 40px;">
                </div>

                <p>
                    After visiting and indexing relevant documents, 
                    the TF-IDF algorithm is applied. This algorithm 
                    detects the featured keywords in the document by 
                    comparing them to other documents. The resulting 
                    words are the more frequently used terms. 
                    These keywords are saved in the index for field boosting during search operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To extract the entities like location and organization, SpaCy's Named Entity Recognition module is used. 
                    Results of the NER were not satisfactory, but entities are still indexed for improving search results.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    Example results for intentionally misspelled word. ElasticSearch is able to search misspelled terms by fuzzy search feature.
                    Location of the searched query in the document is important, thus affects the order of the results. Page title or keywords are 
                    more important than the  in the document.
